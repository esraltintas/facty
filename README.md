# About 
This repo contains some known algorithms to find prime factors of given integer.  
For further reading about algorithms see [my research path](/RESEARCH_PATH.md).

# Limitations
Since these codes are for demonstration purpose only; main focus was keep it as readable as possible. Therefore there might be performance issues and problems with big numbers etc. Dont use or trust this code in production-like environments.

# Known Issues
Right now the only known issue is that i dont know any issue. (Take this socrates!)
